## üìù Task Instructions

### Task 1: Basic Hover Animation
**Branch:** [`Task_1`](https://github.com/bertbigbite/animated_contact_card/tree/Task_1)
1. Create an envelope-style contact button using HTML and CSS.
2. The button should include an icon style element which represents a contact form.
3. Add a hover effect to reveal a the contact card, following the opening of the envelope.
4. Ensure smooth transitions using `opacity` and `transform` properties.

##
### Task 2: Internal Card Animation
**Branch:** [`Task_2`](https://github.com/bertbigbite/animated_contact_card/tree/Task_2)
Extend Task 1 by animating elements inside the 'contact card' using CSS. Implement the following: 

- Using transitions, simulate the completion of the contact form on `hover`, eg, adding transitions to the `width` property.
- Create a `.fake-cursor` that moves, using `transform` and `translate`.
- Add a `.tick` element that appears with `opacity` and `visibility` properties, after a delay in the `:active` state.
- Animate the `.submit-btn` button to change some properties, such as `background-color` or `scale` after a delay.
- Ensure elements return to their default state when not active, using for smooth visibility toggling.

### Task 3: Advanced Envelope Animation
**Branch:** [`Task_3`](https://github.com/bertbigbite/animated_contact_card/tree/Task_3)
1. Use keyframes to animate the envelope opening.
2. On hover:
   - Flip the envelope‚Äôs top flap open, using a skew effect for realism
   - Slightly pop out the contact card.
3. Trigger internal card animations on `:active` instead of `:hover`.

##
#### 4.3: Closing the Popover
**Branch:** [`Task_4.3_closing_modal`](https://github.com/bertbigbite/animated_contact_card/tree/Task_4.3_closing_modal)
1. Implement the `hidePopover()` function to allow closing the modal.
2. Ensure keyboard and click events work for closing.
##
#### 4.4: Advanced Popover Techniques
**Branch:** [`Task_4.4_popover_advanced`](https://github.com/bertbigbite/animated_contact_card/tree/Task_4.4_popover_advanced)
